To run the TFIDF Baseline model:

1.	Install the required scikit-learn package by running the below command on terminal:
	python	
	pip install scikit-learn
	
2.	Run all the cells in-sequence to execute the model and obtain the predictions and evaluation results.

To run the RNN Baseline model:

1.	Install the required packages by running the below command on terminal:
